Heavy-ion EM fields
===================

The code package calculates electromagnetic fields from the spectators and participant nucleons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

When using this code, please cite the following two papers,

* U. Gursoy, D. Kharzeev and K. Rajagopal, Magnetohydrodynamics, charged currents and directed flow in heavy ion collisions, Phys.Rev. C89 (2014) no.5, 054905, arXiv:1401.3805
* U. GÃ¼rsoy, D. Kharzeev, E. Marcus, K. Rajagopal, and C. Shen, Charge-dependent Flow Induced by Magnetic and Electric Fields in Heavy Ion Collisions, arXiv:1806.05288 [hep-ph].

## Compile

To compile the code package, one can use the standard Cmake commands,

```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install
```
